## Author : M ANAND KRISHNA 

### Description

The significance of road safety has never been more paramount, especially at a time when the landscape of vehicular transport is undergoing a revolutionary shift. In the era of smart vehicles and intelligent transport systems, understanding driver behavior and vehicle alerts in real-world scenarios becomes vital. These data insights hold the potential to create safer roads, encourage responsible driving, and significantly reduce accidents. This project delves deep into a comprehensive dataset, capturing 1.8 million real-world events from 130 vehicles over a span of 30 days. The aim was clear: to decipher the complex patterns that unfold on the roads, to identify potential hazards lurking within the data, and to highlight areas where both road infrastructure and driver behavior could be improved. Through this endeavor, the objective wasn't just to interpret the vast array of data, but to harness its insights, all in pursuit of a safer and more informed future on our roads.
